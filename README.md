# NCL Canvas Dark Mode ![Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Owningle/NCL-Canvas-Dark-Mode/main/plugin/icons/icon64.png)

Decided that Canvas would look better in dark mode, so I looked for an extension
online, but I could only find outdated and broken solutions, so I decided to
make my own.

## Installing

Simply install the chrome extension and head over to the NCL Canvas website. You
are also able to change the accent colour by opening the extension popup by
